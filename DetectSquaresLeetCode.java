public class DetectSquaresLeetCode {
    /*You are building a data structure that can do two things:

add(point) → Store a point (x, y) on a 2D graph.

Points can be repeated (so you must remember how many times a point has been added).

count(point) → Given a query point (px, py), you must return how many axis-aligned squares can be formed using this point as one corner.

Axis-aligned square means the square’s sides are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis (not rotated)


Example
Suppose you added these 3 points:
(1,1), (2,2), (1,2)
Now ask:
count([2,1])
We check: Can (2,1) form a square with the points we already added?
